# Blender - Lab 2

Blender is a computer graphics toolkit that is used to create films, art, and 3D models. This tool is helpful in creating objects that can be used in Unity.  

In this lab, I chose to complete Option A and create 10 distrinct pieces of furniture for a bedroom. Every object had texture/material and lighting was also added for depth. 

Attached is my Blender file and Lab Guide.
