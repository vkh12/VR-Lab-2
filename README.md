# Blender - Lab 2

Blender is a computer graphics toolkit that is used to create films, art, and 3D models. This tool is helpful in creating objects that can be used in Unity.  

In this lab, I chose to complete Option A and create 10 distrinct pieces of furniture for a bedroom. Every object had texture/material and lighting was also added for depth. The objects that I created are the following:
* modern desk
* mirror
* book
* chair
* floor rug
* nightstand lamp
* bed
* vase
* nightstand
* wall art

Attached is my Blender file, Lab Guide, and Report.
